# Connecting the dots -- Summer school moin, 20-24 August 2018, Kiel, Germany

This repository is the central hub for our international Summer school where we collect general information, discuss issues and question of all kind related to the event (via Github's issues), and provide material as well as supplementary data. 

The Summer school is supported by the [CAU Kiel](http://www.uni-kiel.de/index-e.shtml) and the Collaborative Research Center 1266 "[Scales of Transformations](https://www.sfb1266.uni-kiel.de/en?set_language=en)".
